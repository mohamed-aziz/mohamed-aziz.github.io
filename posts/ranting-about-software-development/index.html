<h1>Software development rants</h1>

Jun. 4, 2019


<br/><br/>
<p>I work in cybersecurity. I do some programming, but I&rsquo;m not a professional programmer. I took some software design classes in university. Hated them. I love programming just not how enterprise programs are designed:</p>
<ul>
<li>Backend web developers write wrappers around databases.</li>
<li>Frontend web developers write wrappers around wrappers around databases.</li>
<li>Most programmers don&rsquo;t really understand databases.</li>
<li>Programming is a craft not a science, and that&rsquo;s a problem. This allows for opinions not facts.</li>
<li>Programming in java is not fun, even with intellij.</li>
<li>ORM is an anti-pattern.</li>
<li>UML is shit. Scrum and agile are a waste of time and resources for most teams.</li>
<li>I&rsquo;m a <a href="http://programming-motherfucker.com/">programming motherfucker</a>.</li>
<li>Libraries over frameworks any day.</li>
<li>Simplicity over complexity any day.</li>
<li>Functional programs are simple. OO programs are not.</li>
<li>Clojure is simple, Java is not.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t need design patterns for most programs.</li>
<li>You don&rsquo;t need static typing for most programs.</li>
<li>The most beautiful thing about UNIX is program composition through pipelines.</li>
<li>Filters can&rsquo;t be used for everything. sometimes you need monoliths.</li>
<li>Abstraction is not always the solution. see <a href="https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/">The law of leaky abstractions</a>.</li>
<li>Most professional programmers are solving non problems.</li>
<li>Code documentation important only for critical parts (things that are not obvious), or to offer a high level view.</li>
<li>Tools matter.</li>
<li>Textual programming needs to be replaced. This is not 1970 anymore.</li>
<li>IDA is a reverse engineering tool, but it has capabilities that most IDEs don&rsquo;t have (XREF, Graph view&hellip;).</li>
<li>Using the command line is a waste of time, and doesn&rsquo;t make you look smart.</li>
<li>GUI&rsquo;s are far better than command line tools (for example magit for git).</li>
<li>The only thing command line tools offer is flexibility (pipelines) and repeatability (scripting), not talking about curses style programs those are shit.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t understand non-relational databases.</li>
<li>Vi(m) is a meme that has been going on since 1976.</li>
<li>Composition in OO is broken. In functional programs functions are first class citizens.</li>
<li>In a functional program, a function or composition of functions solves a problem. In OO programs, you have 10 interfaces, 20 classes and a factory.</li>
<li>OO is not all evil, an example of beautifully designed OO language is ruby or python. I don&rsquo;t like how professional enterprise programmers solve problems.</li>
<li>I used SQLAlchemy ORM in python made it work like an active record ORM.</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t understand data mapper ORM&rsquo;s.</li>
<li>Programmers design information systems, i.e. systems that deal with data, yet they treat data as a second class citizen.</li>
<li>In clojure, there is no difference between data and code. Quote code, and it becomes data, apply data it and becomes code. No marshalling or serialization needed.</li>
<li>I wish universities use SICP as an introduction to programming.</li>
<li>Unit tests should include security testing.</li>
</ul>
